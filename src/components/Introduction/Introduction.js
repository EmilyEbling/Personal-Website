                        My name is Emily, and I am a recent graduate of Elizabethtown College in central Pennsylvania. I recieved a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, and
                        I also have minors in Mathematics and German. Developing software is not only a hobby of mine, but what I
                        want to spend the rest of my life doing, and I am excited to have accepted an offer as a software engineer with Elsevier.

                        In my free time, you can catch me hiking some of my favorite trails, taking pictures of the beautiful outdoors, or writing
                        short stories! I also have a deep love for cats, plants, The Beatles, and pierogies.
