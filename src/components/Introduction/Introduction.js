                        My name is Emily, and I graduated from Elizabethtown College in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. 
                        I also have minors in Mathematics and German. I accepted an opportunity with Elsevier as a quality engineer after my graduation 
                        and am currently improving my skills in front end development with the hope of pursuing a career in that area.

                        In my free time, you can catch me hiking some of my favorite trails, taking pictures of the beautiful outdoors, or writing
                        short stories! I also have a deep love for cats, plants, The Beatles, and pierogies.
